# DMP-Net
Snapshot Compressive Spectral Reconstruction Method for Hyperspectral Reconstruction of Brain Tissue

DATASET:
Create four folders named CNN_DMP, mask, org_HSI, and org_RGB respectively under the dataset folder.

The CNN_DMP folder contains the RGB2HSI prediction results provided by DMP-Net, which serve as the initial spectral estimation for the subsequent reconstruction task. The download address of the prediction results is: Link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JQH3ody0p_YbUutnDP0GrA?pwd=DMP1
Extraction code: DMP1.

The mask folder contains the random coding masks corresponding to each group of hyperspectral data. The download address is: Link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1YW0A7jJHF7_AuabM5_6XSQ?pwd=DMP1
Extraction code: DMP1

The org_HSI folder contains the original hyperspectral data. The download address is: Link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AnbeGzx_nhCAlPefvLN0gA?pwd=DMP1 
Extraction code: DMP1 

The org_RGB folder contains the RGB images corresponding to each group of hyperspectral data. The download address is: Link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1W6hT1BJL58E9lyK5vz4zOg?pwd=DMP1
Extraction code: DMP1
